# *AI Case Study:*

### [__Google DeepMind__](https://deepmind.google/)

## __Overview and Origin__

* __DeepMind__ __[began](https://deepmind.google/about/)__ in __2010__ with a cross-functional approach to building General AI. __Google Brain__ began in __2011__ exploring how modern AI can transform Google services. __On Janurary 26th 2014__, Google announced it had __[aquired DeepMind](https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/)__ for somewhere between __$500-$650 million__ after negotiations with __[Facebook fell through](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-beat-facebook-for-deepmind-creates-ethics-board)__ in 2013. Both teams were __[combined](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/announcing-google-deepmind/)__ in __April 2023__ for accelerated system development.

* Founded by the __[colloboration](https://blog.google/technology/ai/april-ai-update/)__ of __Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai__ and __DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis__, their __headquarters__ reside in __[London, England](https://www.ses-ltd.co.uk/case-study/kings-cross-s2-building/)__, employing roughly __2,600__ people. 

* The __idea__ for the company came about from nearly __a decade of side-by-side development__ between the two teams, as well as the __need to leverage__ each other's __technologies__, and __the want [to](https://blog.google/technology/ai/april-ai-update/#:~:text=ensure%20the%20bold%20and%20responsible%20development%20of%20general%20AI%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20creating%20a%20unit%20that%20will%20help%20us%20build%20more%20capable%20systems%20more%20safely%20and%20responsibly.)__;

    > <strong><em>"..ensure the bold and responsible development of general AI, weâ€™re creating a unit that will help us build more capable systems more safely and responsibly."</strong></em>
    * __CEO Sundar Pichai__ wanted to __[create](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-shook-up-leadership-ai-era-2024-5)__ a __supergroup__ to focus on __advancing the developments__ of __Android, Chrome,__ and __physical devices__ like the __Pixel Phone__ to turbocharge their ecosystems and __speed up decision making__.

* __Google DeepMind__ is funded by __Venture Capital__, __Individual Investors__ such as __Elon Musk__, __Academic fellowships__, and other __company aquisitions__. They have recieved appoximately __$61.3M__ in funding. As of __Dec 31st, 2023__ they had aquired __$1.53B__ in __[revenue](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-live.ch.gov.uk/docs/AvnjkDORpn5Lbtk5TcI_w-cJqRZW0couea0NmnbdKJc/application-pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAWRGBDBV3K3ZWD7YI%2F20241118%2Feu-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20241118T203709Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEMz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCWV1LXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQD3ZqEa0mMog8EM1wmE5sdJn44Xfpt8ecnc5uAzKWv81gIgMBam%2BtBmGGLS%2FJI8f4kJj8sKGIgszk3awibTwqHa0vkquwUIZRAFGgw0NDkyMjkwMzI4MjIiDEi58CDovjWqmvGl7CqYBScqJ9Z%2B6KxxsArqitavDgTaeKuUxt8cyX4xFAypBeEzt0NngcSgsT06Z9TidgULgJ%2Bta1iSD%2Fhv71W8F3zzySDdfPZews2bOZrtL%2BIc454J%2FtmSc3qqsUpyQ2%2FHEz6MN9Doov9DdyAy1fst54j%2Bl5NzYJ3uBnDZpYqIaVOoaG1wxLTitPcCgVJhHspib6EAzy%2B%2BSVpiG9OCvQQhCoznWbhSkq0D9Injv7kuDDtC6VdgXF%2FZbD3g6Ed1xPLbY14pe3x5Ud9vffcJrrXiZJtWriPaLb5OSwATLQJhb8%2FLqdUTPGwaivuq7VbSacYCCPMUmvtqUp9C8x5i%2BHF0cpMj6nfKyrpVkbJ2HmPT42j2NE%2FeNI8L4qVgWdw5IJs7rY3o2G6YKhQOSPMR6OeHVd8%2Fu%2FfFVLtwfni7vbcimP7GIh29SYqA5OtUfjU3mHQrpVPtAGBRJHZ2SZM5UIKKjKUobwIxLWPv5fz2hbA%2FTqihWpJ%2BQLNXXo%2FEl556jqbVGIcLBm8%2BIVI8trTquJ%2B99jheWMBmf6jGO0714jfcG0NJ7zngWpp5VTpBozL6uuQt6EuqZIxvMYBoA0rVjRZip2ygrkDym9XMa4VsXOfTqLuEqOqXsoNomQ1pGHTQwq1XwzIV%2F%2F5iy21J52Q6xKqkJ8MfkEL1TR6EcWuGDEjy%2BRDmWxJMqlsl2fDfK02jp5gICDvdQxnGUKpXxAGyKbN2C5qt3GsJHPz%2BIRewlIKn2eCzp%2BRsSJc59cGjgcMk1Zy2AbHaV%2FU9j6Ft%2B5NHvL4PgeDSC98elfwx887MrJ8Npi3x1mKJzPhhg8XSulrbDzzIFKmoE%2BziFYy%2FqFptw7er%2BjVx7XqouV6MCVWoYKLsHU6hQwJFSmQPDStJUo0whrXuuQY6sQG8MRViPOVgFZaPDZ7FmXKB3bYr3XGzXkx0laYOjexWdBkf2PZwJhcqJL63lG9L7fp5PzNw%2FojWCMfLfr%2FKBT%2Fq4rzob41HqizXUdNTnj20%2BI5nG5eZ3CuJdUEmyajXlcTzHFP3CqnITdAnGCmpm53IQLJu%2FbWw49eDwgTUEewk2l9RxKn8lGZTj2zJZhN7KFTDC3XnSdj7BjvRfj0Lvvnuo5rQzmjgSzWt7YJ8UMWKVls%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22companies_house_document.pdf%22&X-Amz-Signature=6813395c763a04221128eb1f50c6ecb3d14c453e500c7dae009babd5f181a572)__.

## __Recommendations__

* If __*I*__ were to __advise Google DeepMind__, I would suggest they offer __a product or service__ with a __TRUE solution__ to __quick 3D asset creation for digital enviornments__.
    * __Creating assets__ for __virtual enviornments__ such as __video games__ can require __[hundred of hours](https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-it-take-to-model-one-3D-asset-for-a-video-game-or-real-time-rendering)__ of work from __dozens of people__.
        * __Offloading__ some of this __labor__ onto an __AI__ would drastically __improve effeciency__ and could __help smaller developers__ make __larger projects more quickly__.
* __Currently__, __[Google DreamFusion](https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/)__ is their __"version"__ of this product, __*but*__ because it __[doesn't generate true 3D models](https://medium.com/echo3d/7-generative-ai-tools-for-3d-asset-creation-97dd88153b7#:~:text=Google%E2%80%99s%20version%20of%20generative%20AI%20for%203D%20models%20requires%20no%20training%20on%203D%20model%20data%2C%20but%20they%20also%20generate%203D%20models%20a%20little%20differently%20than%20the%20other%20platforms%20and%20are%20not%20the%20go%2Dto%20tool%20for%20game%20development.)__, but __simply__ what an __image would look__ like from other __3D persperpectives__, it __isn't used__ by __game developers__. 
* __*I*__ think this __product/service__ would __benefit Google DeepMind greatly__ in the fact that they are __[specifically lacking a pressence](https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/)__ in the __videogame developing market__, and could help __win back good will__ in that market after the __[failure of Google Stadia](https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/the-fall-of-stadia)__. 
    * __As well__ as this __product__ being able to __offer a service__ their __competitors can not__.


* This __3D Asset AI__ Product would __utilize Google Deepmind's__ variety of advanced __LLM's__ and __genAI models__, in conjucture with their __[Imagen AI](https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-3/)__, as well as needing to be __trained on__ an open source __asset creation__ tool such as ___[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)___ or __*[Unity](https://unity.com/)*__.
    * This would __allow__ the AI model to __take natural language input__ from a __user__ and/or __[an image](https://shinsoftware.com/en/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-3d-modeling/#:~:text=3D%20Model%20Generation%20from%20AI%20Image%20Processing&text=By%20leveraging%20large%2Dscale%20datasets,depicted%20in%20a%20static%20image.)__ to create the __desired result__ in a __format__ the user can __import__ to other __software and programs__.
        * Or an even simplier solution like what is used by __[Gaxos Labs](https://gaxoslabs.ai/documentation/getting-started)__, with the AI being a plugin you can download right into your development software!

* These __technologies are [required](https://medium.com/echo3d/7-generative-ai-tools-for-3d-asset-creation-97dd88153b7#:~:text=Their%20process%20is%20pre%2Dprocessing,generated%20from%20the%20object%20code.)__ to be able to __understand natural language input__, __identify__ the desired __result__ with __predictive "thinking"__, and __execute the output__ in a __usable format__ for the __user__.
